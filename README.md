### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics in our labs did definitely prepare me to complete the assignment. Specifically learning about API's in Giphy Party was very helpful for using the API's to get the movies. Report Card was also helpful for knowing how to display/hide different div elements. I also think generally all three of the labs were very beneficial for increasing my fluency in HTML/CSS. I didn't feel as prepared to complete the stretch features, specifically embedding the video but I was able to learn with the help of my peers and our TA Vincent! Using resources online was also pretty helpful like StackOverflow and other similar websites.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time I would have liked to add another feature that would let users chooose how the movie images were displayed on the page. For example 3 columns vs 6 columns so they could see different amounts of a movie at one time. I also think it would be cool to search by genre rather than by title explicitly.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

Overall, my project demo went as planned! I was pretty pleased with how users were able to learn more about the movies through watching the movie trailers. One of my peers Caroline had a feature where the search would auto populate as the user tried different searches. I would love to try this next time.
